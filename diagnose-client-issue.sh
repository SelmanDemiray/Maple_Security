echo "==================="
echo ""
echo "Your router shows these clients connected:"
echo "‚Ä¢ 192.168.0.7 (TE)"
echo "‚Ä¢ 192.168.0.205 (TP-Link Device)"
echo "‚Ä¢ 192.168.0.178 (apricot)" 
echo "‚Ä¢ 192.168.0.150 (Network Device 1)"
echo "‚Ä¢ 192.168.0.219 (Wireless Device)"
echo "‚Ä¢ 192.168.0.111 (Network Device 2)"
echo "‚Ä¢ 192.168.0.63 (xman)"
echo ""
echo "But Pi-hole only sees queries from a few sources."
echo ""
echo "‚ùó PRIMARY ISSUE: Clients are NOT using Pi-hole as their DNS server"
echo ""
echo "üîß SOLUTIONS TO TRY:"
echo ""
echo "1. TEST MANUAL DNS CONFIGURATION:"
echo "   On device 192.168.0.63 (xman) or 192.168.0.178 (apricot):"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Set DNS manually to 192.168.0.99"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Test: nslookup google.com"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Should show server 192.168.0.99"
echo ""
echo "2. ROUTER CONFIGURATION ISSUES:"
echo "   Your TP-Link router may have these problems:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ DNS Relay/Proxy enabled (disable it)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Smart DNS or Auto DNS enabled (disable it)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ DHCP not distributing custom DNS servers"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Router needs reboot after DNS change"
echo ""
echo "3. VERIFY ROUTER SETTINGS:"
echo "   Check your router's DHCP settings:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Primary DNS Server: 192.168.0.99"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Secondary DNS Server: 1.1.1.1"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Disable any DNS proxy/relay features"
echo ""
echo "4. FORCE DHCP RENEWAL:"
echo "   On client devices, renew DHCP lease:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Windows: ipconfig /release && ipconfig /renew"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Linux: sudo dhclient -r && sudo dhclient"
echo ""
echo "5. IMMEDIATE TEST:"
echo "   To verify Pi-hole works, manually set DNS on one device:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Go to network settings on 192.168.0.63 (xman)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Set DNS servers: 192.168.0.99, 1.1.1.1"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Visit a website, then check Pi-hole admin panel"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ You should see queries from that device"
echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Run this test first, then we'll know if the issue is:"
echo "   A) Pi-hole not working (unlikely)"
echo "   B) Router not distributing DNS settings (most likely)"

echo ""
echo "üéØ NEXT STEPS:"
echo "1. Test manual DNS on one device"
echo "2. If that works, fix router DHCP/DNS distribution"
echo "3. If that doesn't work, check Pi-hole configuration"
